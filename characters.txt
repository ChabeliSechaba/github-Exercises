Chapter 1
- We meet Catsby, Nick, Tom, Daisy, and
Jordan

William Roberts
A bout half way between West Egg and New York the motor
road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a
quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate
area of land. This is a valley of ashes — a fantastic farm where
ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gar-
dens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and
rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of men
who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery
air. 

James Butter
Occasionally a line of gray cars crawls along an invisible
track, gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and imme-
diately the ash-gray men swarm up with leaden spades and stir
up an impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure opera-
tions from your sight. But above the gray land and the spasms
of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a
moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor
T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic — their irises are one
yard high.
